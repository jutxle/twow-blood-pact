future plans:

// todo: turn into a proper user story
- log professions at death, what they were, their levels.  display in the timeline details section.

- allow user to delete death logs, mostly for debugging purposes
- similiarly lets a pact owner kick players from the pact, mostly for debugging purposes
- look into the accuracy of the xp logged at death.  it might only refect the xp for the single level the character was at, not the xp cummulatively to get there.  maybe load the xp values per level as a static table, and use that to calculate the total xp at death.


- some way to register our account's main hardcore characters with the addon.  display a roster on the pact page, with their characters current, class, level, and gold count + profession level.

- another bug, when a player joins the pact initially I see the user as level 0, possibly stale data or that data is not being synced on initial join of the pact or elsewhere.  the joining player does see the correct levels when joining a pact for the first time.
